# Next Steps

Here's a few suggestions on how to take your project to the next level:
1. **Write tests**:
- Create a test suite to cover edge cases and ensure the correctness of the pallet's functionality.
2. **Runtime Configuration**:
- Right now, the swap fee is fixed 0.3%, see if you can make it a configurable parameter so that it's easier to update.
3. **Hooks and Lifecycle Functions**:
- Implement pallet hooks, such as `on_initialize` and `on_finalize` to perform actions on specific points in the block lifecycle. 
4. **Benchmarking**:
- Set up benchmarking tests to measure the performance of the pallet's dispatchable functions. Use `frame_benchmarking` module to define benchmarks and generate accurate weight information for better transaction fee estimation.
5. **Integration with other pallets**:
- Explore ways to expose the pallet data to other pallets. For example, allow other pallets to call the DEX pallet to fetch pricing data for a specific asset pair.
6: **Front-End Integration**:
- Develop a frontend application using polkadot.js as a user interface for liquidity provision, token swapping and liquidity pool management.
7. **Pricing Oracles**:
- Integrate pricing oracles to fetch real-time asset prices from external sources.
- Use the oracle prices to calculate more accurate exchange rates and ensure fair pricing for swaps.
8: **Cross-chain Interoperability**:
- Explore possibilities of cross-chain liquidity provision and token swapping using the XCM framework.
